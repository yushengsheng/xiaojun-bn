# Release Process

This project must be released from GitHub Actions on a clean `windows-latest` runner.

Rules:
- Do not build release packages only from a local machine.
- Tag the target commit with `v*` and push the tag to trigger `.github/workflows/release-windows-exe.yml`.
- Keep the workflow as the single source of truth for release packaging.
- The release workflow must continue bundling:
  - Python runtime dependencies collected by PyInstaller
  - proxy runtimes downloaded during CI (`xray`, `sing-box`)
  - both onefile and portable onedir packages
- Smoke test both packaged apps with `--selftest` before publishing release assets.

Current release asset naming:
- `xiaojun-bn-<tag>-windows-x64.exe`
- `xiaojun-bn-<tag>-windows-x64.zip`
- `xiaojun-bn-<tag>-windows-x64-portable.zip`

If new internal modules are added, update the workflow hidden imports when needed so packaged builds remain complete.
